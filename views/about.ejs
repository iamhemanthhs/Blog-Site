<h1>What am I learning?</h1>
<p>I'm currently a third year engineering student at Global Academy of Technology. I’m working on procuring depth in DSA, Problem Solving, Javascript and then moving onto learning NodeJS and databases. I’ve Invested my time learning Gastby and I ended up making my Portfolio Website on it!</p>

<h1>Something interesting about me</h1>
<p>I’ve got quick reflexes and the ability to understand concepts quickly. So whenever it comes to athletics or playing a FPS game like CSGO, I squish the competition. Also I’m fond of Chess, it really pushes my mind to think of the future moves possible and that eventually reflects in my work, thinking a couple of steps ahead to solve problems which will later arise.</p>
